# Sliding Window Approach Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to various problems using the sliding window approach. The sliding window approach is a powerful technique used to solve problems related to arrays, strings, and other data structures. The main idea behind this approach is to maintain a window of a specific size and slide it through the input data, performing calculations and updating the result as needed.

The algorithms implemented in this repository are:

1. [Count Occurrences of Anagrams](#count-occurrences-of-anagrams)
2. [First Negative Integer in Every Window of Size K](#first-negative-integer-in-every-window-of-size-k)
3. [Longest K Unique Characters Substring](#longest-k-unique-characters-substring)
4. [Longest Sub-Array with Sum K](#longest-sub-array-with-sum-k)
5. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](#longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)
6. [Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K](#maximum-sum-subarray-of-size-k)
7. [Maximum of all subarrays of size k](#maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k)
8. [Minimum Window Substring](#minimum-window-substring)
