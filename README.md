# Sliding Window Approach Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to various problems using the sliding window approach. The sliding window approach is a powerful technique used to solve problems related to arrays, strings, and other data structures. The main idea behind this approach is to maintain a window of a specific size and slide it through the input data, performing calculations and updating the result as needed.

## Introduction

The sliding window pattern involves maintaining a window (a subarray or substring) of a specific size within the given input and moving this window through the entire input sequence. There are two main variations of the sliding window pattern: fixed-size window and variable-size window.

- **Fixed-Size Window:** In this approach, the size of the window remains constant throughout the process.
- **Variable-Size Window:** In this approach, the size of the window can change based on certain conditions or constraints defined by the problem.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Count Occurrences of Anagrams:** Find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
2. **First Negative Integer in Every Window of Size K:** Find the first negative integer for each window of size k in an array.
3. **Longest K Unique Characters Substring:** Find the longest substring that contains only k unique characters.
4. **Longest Sub-Array with Sum K:** Find the longest subarray with sum k.
5. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:** Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
6. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K:** Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.
7. **Maximum of all subarrays of size k:** Find the maximum element for each window of size k in an array.
8. **Minimum Window Substring:** Find the minimum window in s which will contain all the characters in t.
9. **Permutation in String:** Check if one string is a permutation of another string.
